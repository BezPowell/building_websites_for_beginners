<p>This book aims to provide a gentle introduction to building websites from scratch for the complete beginner; someone who is comfortable browsing the web and navigating their way around websites, but who has never tried to edit a webpage and knows nothing about the technologies that make them work. The only knowledge that I assume you will have is being able to open a browser and navigate to a web page and knowing how to create, edit and save documents with a computer text editor. Everything else will be explained as we go along.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#what-well-cover" id="what-well-cover">What we'll cover</a></h2>
<p>Over the course of this book I hope to introduce you to HTML, CSS and JS, the 'languages' of the web and show you how to use them to build simple web sites. If the mere mention of acronyms like these makes your eyes start to glaze over, don't worry, all will be explained and by the time you get to the end these should be as familiar as terms you use in your everyday life.</p>
<p>The best way to learn how to do something is to actually do it, and websites are no exception. We'll create two simple websites over the course of the book: a single-page portfolio website that we'll slowly develop as we go along, adding pieces as we learn the concepts behind them; and a final project which will be a rather more complex blog website that will bring together much of what we've learned earlier as well as introducing some new techniques.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#why-read-this-book" id="why-read-this-book">Why read this book?</a></h2>
<p>There is a wealth of high quality material available on the web and in book form for those who are interested in learning to build websites, much of it written by people far more knowledgeable and experienced than myself; with that confession out of the way it may seem strange to write another guide when there are already so many available, but my reasons for doing this have a lot to do with the history of the web itself<sup id="a1"><a href="s0.html#f1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The web has not always been like it is now. When it first came into being at CERN during the 1990s web pages consisted of little more than text and a few images. Humans being humans, however, people soon started trying to build things on the web that it had not originally been designed with in mind. As developer's imaginations rapidly oustripped the limited tools available in the original specifications, they had to resort to various hacks and workarounds to try and implement them. Over the years, as certain trends became more common place, web browsers (and those who write the specifications that govern the web) started to offer more sophisticated tools to create them.</p>
<p>The result of this process of evolution is that there are often multiple ways of achieving the same goal when it comes to building websites. Many existing books and tutorials teach these in the same way that the person writing them would have learnt them; starting with the early workarounds and only teaching the newer, purpose-built techniques when you have mastered the old way of doing things.</p>
<p>For me personally, when I came to learn web development and later to teach it to others, this always felt a little backwards as the newer techniques are often quicker to pick up (even if they may seem a little counter-intuitive to someone who is used to the more established ways of doing things) and can result in websites which are quicker to load and easier to modify in the future.</p>
<p>With that in mind, that is how the book will progress, teaching you contemporary ways of doing things<sup id="a2"><a href="s0.html#f2">2</a></sup> wherever possible, and only mentioning older workarounds where it seems necessary. With that introduction out of the way, let's get started.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#what-youll-need" id="what-youll-need">What you'll need</a></h2>
<p>One of the best bits of building websites is that the tools required are very simple indeed. All of the languages of the web mentioned earlier are text based, just like written human languages. So to create websites all you need is a text editor<sup id="a3"><a href="s0.html#f3">3</a></sup> and a web browser to view it in.</p>
<p>Whatever is the default text editor your operating system comes with will be sufficient (e.g. notepad on Windows, often gedit on Linux etc.). However, there are dedicated text editors designed for programming and web development which come with a variety of features to make your life easier as they can highlight mistakes and cut down on repetitive typing. I personally use a free editor called <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>, but <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> and <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a> are also very good choices.</p>
<p>While technically it may well be possible to follow along with these tutorials on a phone or tablet, the experience is likely to be anything but pleasant. Web development involves a lot of typing and switching between windows, which is not something mobile devices are really designed for. In light of this, I do highly recommend you follow these tutorials on a desktop or laptop as it will make your life much easier. However, I make no assumptions on what type of device this will be, or the operating system that you run on it, use whatever you are most comfortable with.</p>

    <li id="f1">There is also a second, dark ulterior motive to the writing of this which is to refine my own skills. It is often said that the best way of improving your understanding of a subject is to try and teach it to others; little do my readers realize that they are merely pawns in my ascendency to figurative web development godhood.... ahem.</li>
    <li id="f2">In web development, as in most other things in life, there is definitely more than one way to skin a cat and there is generally no one 'best' way of achieving something. What I will cover is (hopefully) a good way of doing things using contemporary technologies.</li>
    <li id="f3"> This must be an actual text editor such as notepad as opposed to a word processor such as Microsoft Word as word processors add additional formatting to documents which will prevent webpages from working correctly.</li>

<h1><a class="header" href="#html" id="html">HTML</a></h1>
<p>Before we start learning to build websites, it would be beneficial to briefly explore (a simplified version of) what goes on 'under the hood' whenever you view a web page.</p>
<p>When you type a web address into your browser's address bar (for the purposes of this example we will use one that should be familiar to most: www.google.com) your browser must first make what is called a DNS lookup. This essentially involves consulting an online address book to find the location of the computer (the server) where the website is stored (hosted). Using this address the browser then makes a request to the server for the page that you want to view.</p>
<p>All being well, the server should respond to this request by sending the page back as a .html file. This .html file contains the content of the page you wish to view and your browser uses this to render the page on your computer (displaying it on the screen for many users, but also reading it out for those who are blind or have a visual impairment).</p>
<p>To build websites, therefore, we need to create them in the format that browsers can understand: HTML.</p>
<p>HTML stands for Hyper-Text Markup Language. Hyper-Text is essentially techno-geek speak for documents that link to other documents. To return to the example of www.google.com, when you make a search on google it scans the web for pages that might match the words you are looking for, and presents them as a list of links sorted by what it feels are the most relevant. Selecting any of these links will take you to that page so you can continue your search. It would probably not be exaggerating things much to say that links between documents are the single thing that contributes the most to the usefulness of the internet.</p>
<p>To continue on with our breakdown of HTML you will notice that the L stands for language. In this case we are not referring to a language like English, Chinese, or Arabic, that is used by people to communicate with on another, but instead what is know as a computer language; which allows people to communicate with computers.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, computers deal in binary, familiar to most as longs string of 0s and 1s like this: 011001100. Having to use binary everytime we want to tell a computer to do something would obviously become very tedious and error prone, so very clever people have invented a whole series of languages which are closer to those you would use in everyday life and which we can use to write instructions that the computer will then convert to binary before it follows them. There are a whole host of different computer languages for different use cases, and HTML is the one we use for describing websites.</p>
<p>That, then, just leaves us with Markup. Markup describes the fact that HTML is a language for marking up documents; annotating parts of them to give them additional meaning. These annotations are what allow the browser to determine whether a particular part of the page is a piece of text or an image (along with a whole host of other possibilities) and serve as the instructions for how to build the page.</p>
<p>In the next chapter we will start to look at how html documents are formed.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#tags-and-elements" id="tags-and-elements">Tags and Elements</a></h1>
<p>Web pages are just specially formatted text files. As alluded to in the previous chapter, the web browser needs to know what form the various pieces of content take in order to reconstruct the page for display or reading out. This is achieved through the use of tags. Here's a simple example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;h3&gt;I like cats&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like cats&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Above you can see two identical lines of text, surrounded on either side by a series of strange looking characters. When the browser comes to actually display the page they will look like this.</p>
<figure>
    <h3><a class="header" href="#i-like-cats" id="i-like-cats">I like cats</a></h3>
    <p>I like cats</p>
</figure>
<p>The characters on either side of the line of text are the tags. The opening <code>&lt;</code> and closing <code>&gt;</code> angle brackets denote that this is a tag as opposed to actual content and the letters and/or numbers in between determine the type of tag it is (its identifier). In the example above the first line is a level 3 heading (html has 6 levels of heading of differing importance, <code>h1</code> being the most important and <code>h6</code> the least) and the second is a paragraph.</p>
<p>When the browser comes to process the html file it will see the opening tag (e.g. <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>) and know that everything following it until the closing tag (e.g. <code>&lt;/h3&gt;</code>) is the same type of content. The backslash <code>/</code> directly following the opening bracket of the second tag denotes that it is a closing, rather than opening, tag.</p>
<p>The whole section of text including the opening and closing tags, as well as the content in between them, is referred to as an element. In this case the first line is a <code>h3</code> element and the second a <code>p</code> element. A web page is just a collection of different elements.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#element-relationships" id="element-relationships">Element relationships</a></h2>
<p>Elements don't have to proceed purely one after another, however, and can be nested inside one another to represent complex relationships. These relationships are very much like those you have with other members of your family, and thus share similar names with them. Any elements added in between the opening and closing tags of an element become 'descendants' of that element and will become associated with it. Time for another example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Todo list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Wake up&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Have breakfast&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Learn more about HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>What we have here is a series of <code>li</code> elements, nested inside an <code>ol</code> element. An <code>ol</code> is an ordered list, and <code>li</code> stands for list item. Here the <code>ol</code> is the parent of the <code>li</code> elements, which are in turn siblings of one another.</p>
<p>When rendered by the browser, the above html will look like this:</p>
<figure>
    <p>Todo list</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Wake up</li>
        <li>Have breakfast</li>
        <li>Learn more about HTML</li>
    </ol>
</figure>
<p>The advantage of being able to form relationships between elements like this is it brings additional context to information. Here we can see that not only are the <code>li</code> elements items in a list, but they are all members of the same list and should be processed in a particular order. Consider another example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Todo list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Wake up&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Have breakfast&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Learn more about HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favourite foods&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Pizza&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Pasta&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Cake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Here we have added another list after the first, in this case, however, it is an unordered list, or <code>ul</code>. While we now have 6 <code>li</code> elements, they are not all member's of the same list, and thus should be treated separately. Also, while the second list still represents related items, they do not have any particular ordering associated with them. Here's how the modified example appears when rendered by a browser:</p>
<figure>
    <p>Todo list</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Wake up</li>
        <li>Have breakfast</li>

        <li>Pizza</li>
        <li>Pasta</li>
        <li>Cake</li>
    </ul>
</figure>
<p>There is no limit to the number of levels that elements can be nested, and most webpages will have a large number of different elements with complex relationships resembling the most well-researched family trees.</p>
<p>We've covered quite a lot in this chapter, so don't worry if it doesn't all take first time. Even experienced web developers often need to go over new material several times before they fully understand it. As long as you comprehend the principles behind what you've just read you should be fine and shouldn't need to remember the specifics; it will become second nature soon enough.</p>
<p>In the next chapter we'll look at our first web page.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#hello-world" id="hello-world">Hello world</a></h1>
<p>Now that you know what html tags and elements are we can look at our first webpage. There is an old tradition when learning any new computer language to first write something to display the sentence &quot;Hello world!&quot; to confirm everything is working correctly, and we are going to follow this.</p>
<p>To start with, please create a new file somewhere where you will keep your new webpages and call it <code>hello_world.html</code>, then open the file in a text editor and paste the following lines into it:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;

&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;

    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Hello world&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Hello world!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If you then save the file and open it with a web browser you should see something like this:</p>
<p><img src="./images/s1c3/01.png" alt="hello_world.html rendered in Firefox" /></p>
<p>There is a little bit more html here than I have shown you previously, but we will go over it line by line to explain what each element does.</p>
<p>The first element in the document is <code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;</code>, this is simply a marker to tell the web browser that the document is a html document. It also indicates that this document is formatted according to the HTML5 specification<sup id="a1"><a href="s1c3.html#f1">1</a></sup>, which is the current standard.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#attributes" id="attributes">Attributes</a></h2>
<p>The next element is a bit more interesting as it introduces something we've not encountered before, have a look at just the html element, I've put an ellipsis character <code>…</code> in between the opening and closing tags to indicate that there is other content there that we are not currently interested in.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
    …
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You will notice that there is some other text in the opening tag, after the tag type, but before the closing angle bracket. This is what is called an attribute. Attributes give additional meaning to elements than their type alone confers. In the case of the html element, it has a language attribute indicating that the content of the webpage is written in the English language. Other possibilities include <code>fr</code> for French and <code>ar</code> for Arabic<sup id="a2"><a href="s1c3.html#f2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Attributes consist of the name of the attribute (what type it is), an <code>=</code> sign and the value of the attribute (almost always enclosed in quotation marks <code>&quot;&quot;</code>). Elements can have any number of attributes and they are separated from one another (and the tag name) by a space.</p>
<p>The other thing to note is that, as the <code>html</code> element wraps everything else in the document, it is the ancestor for every element on the page. It is often referred to as the 'root' element as, like the roots of a tree, all the branches are descended from it.</p>
<p>The <code>html</code> element always has two children, <code>head</code> and <code>body</code>. As you may be able to deduce from comparing the code for the webpage with what is displayed when viewing it in a browser, the <code>body</code> element contains all the actual content for the page; any elements that you add as descendants of the <code>body</code> will be rendered by the browser when someone views the page. The two elements which are inside the <code>head</code> tags don't seem to be being displayed, so what is their purpose? The answer to that is that they are proving 'metadata' about the page.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#metadata" id="metadata">Metadata</a></h2>
<p>To quote wikipedia: &quot;Metadata is data that provides information about other data&quot;. That may sound opaque and possibly a little intimidating, but the concept is actually quite simple. If we were to for a moment pretend that our website was actually a piece of music on our computer, the body of the page would be the song itself and the head would be all the information about the song; such as its Title, the Artist, Composer, Album it is from, and Year in which is was recorded. None of this 'metadata' forms part of the song itself, but it provides us with a lot of additional information about it. Similarly, if you were to view a photograph on your computer, it might also have some metadata attached to it proving information about when the photograph was taken, what camera and lens were used to take it, and what the exposure settings were.</p>
<p>The elements in a html document's <code>head</code> are no different, and provide information to the browser and user about the page. In the case of our example above, there are only two elements in the head, but there can be many more. The first element is a <code>meta</code> element, with the <code>charset</code> attribute. All text on a computer is stored using a particular &quot;character set&quot; which tells the computer how to convert the binary 1s and 0s into letters, a little like morse code allows transferring messages using only dots and dashes. The <code>charset</code> attribute tells the browser that the text on the page is encoded using the <code>utf-8</code> character set, which is generally the one used on the web.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#empty-elements" id="empty-elements">Empty elements</a></h2>
<p>You may notice that there is something unusual about the <code>meta</code> element that we have not encountered before; it is missing a corresponding end tag. The vast majority of html tags are used to provide meaning to pieces of content, such as the <code>h3</code> and <code>p</code> elements we have seen previously. <code>meta</code> elements, however, do not wrap any content, and exist purely as containers for attributes. To save you having to type out both opening and closing tags for elements like these, and to avoid them being given any child elements which would be considered invalid, HTML requires you to skip the closing tag entirely.</p>
<p>There are a few of these empty elements and we will encounter some of the others later. While HTML5 allows you to type out the element as if it was just an opening tag (e.g. <code>&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;</code>), previous versions of the specification required you to explicitly mark them out as self-closing by adding a forward slash <code>/</code> before the closing angle bracket, and it is a good idea to do this so you can tell at a glance which elements are empty. Throughout this book I will use the convention of adding a forward slash to all self-closing tags.</p>
<p>The only other element in the head is a <code>title</code> element with the content &quot;Hello world&quot;. As the name suggests, the title element tells the browser what the page's title is, and is used on browser tabs and and when the page appears in search results. Try changing this and refreshing the page, the title of the open tab should change to whatever new text you have entered.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#body-content" id="body-content">Body content</a></h2>
<p>The other child of the <code>html</code> element is the <code>body</code> element and, as alluded to above, includes the actual content of the page. For now we just have a <code>h1</code> element with the content &quot;Hello World!&quot;. Try changing this text, or adding in some of the elements we covered in the last section and refreshing the page in the browser to see how adding elements to the body changes what the browser displays; make sure you remember to save the text document though, otherwise the changes you make will not be rendered. </p>

    <li id="f1">HTML has gone through several major revisions in its history, each one adding (and occasionally removing) features.</li>
    <li id="f2">The lang attribute can also be added to other elements on the page where you have text in multiple languages.

</ol><h1><a class="header" href="#starting-the-first-website" id="starting-the-first-website">Starting the first website</a></h1>
<p>Now that we have seen how html documents are structured we can start building our first webpage. For the rest of this section we will expand upon our knowledge of HTML by building a simple portfolio page, adding sections to it as we learn about some of the different types of elements that are available to use. Then, in the next section on CSS, we will add some styling to make the page more visually interesting. By the end of the CSS section we should have a completed webpage that looks a bit like this:</p>
<p><img src="./images/s1c4/Desktop_styled.jpg" alt="Our first website viewed on a computer" /></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#content-styling-interactivity" id="content-styling-interactivity">Content. Styling. Interactivity.</a></h2>
<p>You may remember that in the introduction I talked about the web being made up of three main languages (HTML, CSS &amp; JS) and that, while we have only just started learning about HTML, I have already started talking about CSS. Panic ye not, there is a reason for this.</p>
<p>Back in the early days of the web all pages were built entirely in HTML, which has very little scope for modifying the appearance of individual elements. If someone wanted to change the way a particular part of the page looked, therefore, they would often have to change which elements they were using. A common example of this is trying to make headings look smaller by replacing all <code>h1</code> tags with <code>h2</code> tags, or even, <code>h3</code><sup id="a1"><a href="s1c4.html#f1">1</a></sup>. This comes with some major downsides.</p>
<p>Humans are very good at inferring contextual information from the visual relationships between objects. Machines (and those humans who can not see), however, are not and the content of a page where any text that you wanted to make bigger had been wrapped in heading tags would read very differently to them. As a result, any page built with elements selected for visual appearance rather than meaning can be very difficult for screen reader users to understand, and would likely appear incorrectly when being indexed by a search engine, or in any other system where a machine first processes the page.</p>
<p>To overcome this difficulty, webpages are now built using more than one language. HTML is used purely to describe the content of the page, while CSS controls the appearance and JS any additional interactive elements that are needed. By having a separation of concerns between the different languages like this, we can ensure that our websites will work in the widest possible context; there is no point making a beautiful website if no one can find it using a search engine and when they do stumble upon it by accident they can not use it if they have any disabilities.</p>
<p>HTML also comes with a lot of functionality already implemented by browsers that, if you use the wrong element for the job, you either have to recreate yourself, or lose altogether. Despite the advantages of using HTML purely to describe the content of a page, many people still try and use it to handle appearance and layout as well. Please don't fall into this trap as it will make life a lot more difficult for both you and your users.</p>
<p>I mention all of this because firstly it is important<sup id="a2"><a href="s1c4.html#f2">2</a></sup>, and secondly because after the end of the section on HTML our first website will actually look rather more like this:</p>
<p><img src="./images/s1c4/Desktop_unstyled.jpg" alt="A plain html view of our first website" /></p>
<p>Please don't let this put you off. It might not look like much, but it will be the solid foundations from which you can build an amazing website. Before you know it you will have also got the hang of CSS and will be building useful <em>and</em> beautiful websites.</p>
<p>That's enough talking from me, let's get our hands dirty with some more HTML.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#footnotes-2" id="footnotes-2">Footnotes</a></h3>
<ol>
    <li id="f1">Though there are many others such as turning links into buttons, or even using images for text.</li>
    <li id="f2">I really do apologise for going on so much about this topic. Rants like this will be kept to an absolute minimum I promise.</li>
</ol><h1><a class="header" href="#basic-page-structure" id="basic-page-structure">Basic page structure</a></h1>
<p>In this chapter we're going to begin work on the initial html structure of our first website. The core purpose of any html document<sup id="a1"><a href="s1c5.html#f1">1</a></sup> is to convey information; whether that is the particulars of a breaking news story, the recipe to cook a certain dish, or even the various prices and specifications of different products that visitors might like to purchase. If you look at a selection of different pages from across the web, however, you may notice that they frequently contain a lot more than just this core content. This very often takes the form of elements which are shared across the site, such as a header with navigation and the site logo, or a footer with copyright information, but can also be supporting information more specific to the page, such as a sidebar with a list of related posts.</p>
<p>As all of this ancillary information is separate from the main page content, we want to contain it in different elements in order to differentiate it. First things first, though, we need to create our new project. Typing out the required elements of a page every time you start a new project can become quite tedious and error prone, fortunately, we already created a minimal page that we can use as a starting point in Chapter 3. Copy <code>hello_world.html</code> into a new folder that will contain all the files for our current project<sup id="a2"><a href="s1c5.html#f2">2</a></sup> and rename it to <code>index.html</code>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#website-file-structure" id="website-file-structure">Website file structure</a></h2>
<p>The reason that we are renaming the file is that, when you come to actually upload your website to the web, the server that hosts it will need to locate which file it should serve to visitors when they request a particular page. The convention is generally to have each page in its own folder, with the structure of the folders mirroring that of the pages on the website<sup id="a3"><a href="s1c5.html#f3">3</a></sup>. When the server comes to look in the appropriate folder for a particular page, it will first look for a file called <code>index.html</code>, so we're just making its job as easy as possible.</p>
<p>Once you have copied and renamed the file, the next step is to open it in a text editor and remove the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element from the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, so that it looks something like this.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;

&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;

&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;

    &lt;title&gt;My website&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This is about the minimum information a browser needs to properly load and render a page and we will expand upon this by adding all of the content for the page into the empty <code>body</code>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#header" id="header">&lt;header&gt;</a></h2>
<p>The first thing we are going to add to the page is a <code>header</code> element. Add the following lines<sup id="a4"><a href="s1c5.html#f4">4</a></sup> right after the end of the opening <code>body</code> tag:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;header&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello, I'm Catwaladr Caractapus.&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I'm the king of the Catuvellauni and passionate about string, mice, boxes, and other such important
        things. This page details my achievements, so all may bask in my glory.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;./images/pexels-kirsten-bühne-1521304.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Grey cat with yellow eyes sitting on grass.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>header</code> element serves as a container for introductory content about the page, such as the page's title, date it was created, the author, brand image etc. In this case we have added the page title as a <code>h1</code> and a short introductory paragraph contained in the <code>p</code> element. As mentioned above, the header does not represent the main content of the page, but rather supporting information that tells us more about it. In some respects, it is a little like the <code>head</code> element we encountered earlier, but with the important distinction that, because it is a descendent element of the <code>body</code>, anything contained within it will be displayed to the user.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#replaced-elements" id="replaced-elements">Replaced elements</a></h2>
<p>The last child of the header is a new type of element we have not seen before, an <code>img</code>. Img stands for image, and is the tag used to add images to a page. It is also one of a handful of special tags referred to as 'replaced elements'.</p>
<p>Because HTML files are text files, and most image formats are stored as binary, we can not embed them directly into web pages. Instead, we must use an <code>img</code> element with a <code>src</code> attribute that contains the location of the image we want to embed into the page. When the browser comes to process the html file it sees the <code>img</code> tag and looks for an actual image in the location pointed at by the <code>src</code> attribute. If it finds an image it then displays it at the same location as the <code>img</code> element. Video and audio clips also have to be embedded into pages in a similar way (using a <code>video</code> and <code>audio</code> element respectively) for the same reason.</p>
<p>When browsing the web you may have occasionally seen a strange little icon like this where instead you expected to seen an image:</p>
<p><img src="./images/s1c5/no_image.png" alt="Browser no image icon" /></p>
<p>As the image referenced to by an <code>img</code> tag is stored separately, there is no guarantee that the browser will be able to load it and, rarely, you will instead get this icon; either because the referenced image has moved, or the connection to download it was interrupted.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#paths" id="paths">Paths</a></h2>
<p>The <code>src</code> attribute on our <code>img</code> is pointing to <code>./images/pexels-kirsten-bühne-1521304.jpg</code>. If you are using Mac or Linux this probably looks very familiar to you, but Windows users might be wondering why the slashes are facing forwards (<code>/</code>) instead of backwards (<code>\</code>), so we will take a few moments to explore how paths work on the web.</p>
<p>The web uses Unix<sup id="a5"><a href="s1c5.html#f5">5</a></sup> style paths. In this system, directory levels are seperated by a forwards slash <code>/</code>. The <code>./</code> at the start of the path denotes it is a <em>relative</em> path, one that starts from wherever the current file is. Paths can also be <em>absolute</em> (starting with a forward slash <code>/</code>), which means that they start from the <code>root</code>, in the case of a website this is usually the location of the homepage's <code>index.html</code>.</p>
<p>Using this slightly simplified model of how paths work we can deduce that the server will be looking for a file called <code>pexels-kirsten-bühne-1521304.jpg</code> in the <code>images</code> folder that resides in the same location as the <code>index.html</code> file that is referencing it. If this is a little over your head at this point, don't worry, you'll soon get the hang of it. All you need to remember is that the webpages you will be creating are all .html files that need to reference other files on the server, so the paths you enter into any <code>src</code> attributes need to reflect this.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#alt-tags" id="alt-tags">Alt tags</a></h2>
<p>The other attribute on our <code>img</code> element is an <code>alt</code> attribute, often erroneously referred to as an alt tag. As images are a purely visual medium, they can not convey any meaning to visitors using a screen reader, and the <code>alt</code> attribute contains a text alternative to the image that will be read out instead. This text will also be displayed alongside the above icon in situations where the image fails to load.</p>
<p>While the alt attribute is not required, you should always include one with your images to help visitors with a disability better understand the content of the page. In cases where an image is purely decorative, and reading out a text alternative might be confusing, you can leave the alt attribute empty like so <code>alt=&quot;&quot;</code>; most screen readers will read out the entire image url in cases where there is no alt attribute present, which would be even more confusing, by leaving it empty the screen reader will instead remain silent when it reaches the <code>img</code> element.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#footer" id="footer">&lt;footer&gt;</a></h2>
<p>We are also going to add a simple footer to our page containing copyright information. Copy and paste the following lines right before the closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;footer&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Copyright &amp;copy; Catwaladr Caractapus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/footer&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>footer</code>, just like the <code>header</code>, contains supporting information not directly related to the main page content. Here we are just adding copyright information, but contact details and further navigation links are also common.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#html-entities" id="html-entities">HTML Entities</a></h2>
<p>The funny looking <code>&amp;copy;</code> is what is known as a html entity. In HTML, certain characters are reserved by the language and, if typed, will instead be interpreted as part of an element (for example the opening and closing angle brackets <code>&lt;&gt;</code>). If we want to actually use these in text we must instead type in the corresponding entity, which will be interpreted by the browser and displayed as if it were the correct character.</p>
<p>They all follow the format of starting win an ampersand <code>&amp;</code>, having a type, and ending with a semi-colon <code>;</code>. There are also entities for characters that don't generally appear on a keyboard, and <code>&amp;copy;</code> is converted by the browser into the copyright symbol ©. For a complete list of all available html entities have a look at the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/named-characters.html#named-character-references">official specification</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#wrapping-up" id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</a></h2>
<p>With the <code>footer</code> added we now have all the supplementary information that we will use for the page complete. We've covered a lot of ground in this chapter, so don't worry if all of it didn't stick the first time around and you have to read through some of it again. If all has gone well your first webpage should now have a similar structure to the code snippet below:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;

&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;

&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;

    &lt;title&gt;My website&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;header&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Hello, I'm Catwaladr Caractapus.&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            I'm the king of the Catuvellauni and passionate about string, mice, boxes, and other such important
            things. This page details my achievements, so all may bask in my glory.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;../website_1_final/images/pexels-kirsten-bühne-1521304.jpg&quot;
            alt=&quot;Grey cat with yellow eyes sitting on grass.&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;footer&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Copyright &amp;copy; Catwaladr Caractapus&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>and look something a little like this when viewed in a web browser (though obviously with different content if you are using your own):</p>
<p><img src="./images/s1c5/first_page.jpg" alt="This chapter's code viewed in Firefox." /></p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#main-and-section" id="main-and-section">&lt;main&gt; and &lt;section&gt;</a></h2>
<p>The first new element we have added here is a <code>main</code> element as a sibling to the <code>header</code> and <code>footer</code>. Just as the <code>footer</code> and <code>header</code> elements represent the footer and header of a document, so too does the <code>main</code> element serve as a container for the page's primary, or dominant, content. You should only have a single <code>main</code> element per page, and all of the document's primary content should be a descendant of it.</p>
<p>The child of our new <code>main</code> element is a <code>section</code> element. The <code>section</code> element is used to group related content that does not necessarily have a more specific element available, such as the headers and footers we have already seen, and it should have a heading element as a child to describe what the content of the section is.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section">Mozilla Developer Network</a> suggests that you should use a <code>section</code> where &quot;a section should logically appear in the outline of a document&quot;; for example, if we were creating a page detailing the recipe for a particular meal, we might choose to contain all of the ingredients in one section, and the steps to cook the meal in another. Here, of course, we have used it as a container for the biographical paragraphs.</p>
<p>As the word <em>suggests</em> in the proceeding paragraph implies, there are very few strict rules for building web pages, and it often comes down to using whichever element seems most appropriate. The best guide is to be as specific as possible without altering the meaning of your content (e.g. don't wrap content in a heading just because you can, but if it actually is a heading always mark it as such), as this makes it easy for people and machines to understand it. In the case of <code>section</code>s, the suggestion to think of a document outline is a very good one; think about how you would try and find the information you need if you were speed-reading the page. If someone was only interested in getting in touch with us, they might not wish to read through the rest of the page first. Wrapping related elements together in sections like this helps visitors to find the part of the document they are interested in.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#a-gallery" id="a-gallery">A Gallery</a></h2>
<p>The next thing we are going to add to the page is a gallery showcasing some of the author's work, and we will make this another section. Copy and past the following line after the end of the previous <code>section</code>, and before the end of the <code>main</code>:</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;/section&gt;

<p>The first child of the new <code>section</code> is a <code>h2</code> describing what the section contains. The <code>img</code>, <code>ul</code> and <code>li</code> elements we have already seen before, they are just being combined here in a new way. There are several ways you could represent an image gallery in HTML, but I like to use a list as I feel that makes the most sense semantically; we are listing out some of the author's work, and those pieces happen to be represented as images.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#wrapping-up-1" id="wrapping-up-1">Wrapping up</a></h2>
<p>After adding the image gallery, your page code should resemble this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;

&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;

&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;

<p>and look something a little like this when viewed in a web browser (though obviously with different content if you are using your own):
<img src="./images/s1c6/end_of_chapter.jpg" alt="This chapter's code viewed in Firefox." /></p>
<p>If your page doesn't look right, or you think you've made a mistake somewhere, don't worry! As the examples get more complex, it will get increasingly easy to miss out a line when copying, or to accidentally paste it into the wrong place. Take a few minutes and see whether you can figure out what's gone wrong yourself and fix it. If you can't, or would just like to check against my own version you can find the original files I worked from in the <a href="https://github.com/BezPowell/building_websites_for_beginners/blob/master/code/s1c6/index.html">book's source code</a>. There are also files for all the other chapters there as well if you would like to study them. It's also possible I have made a mistake with one of the examples; if you do spot this please let me know at <a href="mailto:bez@pinopticon.net">bez@pinopticon.net</a> so I can fix it.</p>
<p>In the next chapter we will add the cv table which will introduce us to a few more html elements.  </p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#tables" id="tables">Tables</a></h1>
<p>The next thing we are going to work on for our page is the details of our author's past employments. Before we start writing any HTML, however, we should take a brief moment to think about how it would be best to represent it. If you look at a typical CV, as well as the employer, they generally contain information about the job title, dates of employment, and a paragraph or two detailing what the job actually entailed. We could convey this by having the job titles or employers as some form of heading element, and any other information as paragraphs; but this would not properly express the fact that each of these fields are related to one another.</p>
<p>The perfect element to represent such 2-dimensional data is a table and, is often what is used on paper CVs as well. Tables in HTML, unfortunately, do how a small number of minor drawbacks, the main one being the difficulty of representing a two dimensional grid in a markup language. As a result of this, the markup for tables is probably the most complex of any element you will encounter when building websites. So instead of overwhelming you with the final code for the section as I have done previously, we will first learn about how to create tables in a series of smaller stages. This won't take long, I promise.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#table-rows-and-data" id="table-rows-and-data">Table rows and data</a></h2>
<p>The first element we need to create a table is aptly named the <code>table</code>. This serves as the container for all of the data and indicates that anything inside of it is part of the table. The table contents are then split up into rows, represented by <code>tr</code> elements (which stand for table row). Each row then has it's cell data populated using <code>td</code> elements (which stand for table data). Confused? Let's look at an example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Country&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Population&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Language&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;UK&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;63,182,000&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;English&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;France&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;64,898,000&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Français&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Germany&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;80,219,695&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Deutsch&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This represents a table with 4 rows and 3 columns. As you can see, each <code>tr</code> is a child of the <code>table</code>, and the <code>td</code> elements are children of the <code>tr</code> rows. When displayed on a page it will look like this:</p>
<figure>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Country</td>
            <td>Population</td>
            <td>Language</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>UK</td>
            <td>63,182,000</td>
            <td>English</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>France</td>
            <td>64,898,000</td>
            <td>Français</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Germany</td>
            <td>80,219,695</td>
            <td>Deutsch</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</figure>
<p>We do not explicitly declare columns in HTML, instead they are inferred from the number of cells in each row. This format can feel extremely unwieldy when you first encounter it but, as mentioned earlier, stems from the difficulty of trying to lay out a grid using markup. If we actually tried to lay out cells in the same way they appear, the browser would have to infer where columns started and ended, which might result in a different layout from what you intended. After you have worked on a few pages with tables you should get the hang of it and it will become second nature.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#table-headings" id="table-headings">Table Headings</a></h2>
<p>We now have a basic table, but there is still some critical information missing. Someone looking at the table as rendered by the browser may well be able to guess that the top row represents the column headings, but the markup does not convey this; each row, has an identical structure. To remove this ambiguity we can use a <code>th</code> element with a <code>scope</code> attribute, instead of a <code>td</code>, for any headings. Which will make life easier for any machines or screen reader users reading our page. Have a look at the example below:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;Country&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;Population&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;Language&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;63,182,000&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;English&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;France&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;64,898,000&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Français&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;Germany&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;80,219,695&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Deutsch&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>What we have done here is to replace all of the <code>td</code> elements in the first row with <code>th</code> elements to define them as the headings for the table columns. The <code>scope</code> attribute must have a value of either <code>col</code> or <code>row</code> to define whether it is acting as a heading for a column or row.</p>
<p>We have also made the first cell in each of the other rows a heading; this shows that the population and language columns apply to the country, rather than, for example, the UK being the official country of the English language or Deutsch the official language of the number 80,219,695. This might seem unnecessary for people used to languages that read from left to right, as we assume that the first element we see is the most important, but again, this is just about being explicit.  When rendered by a browser our updated table will look like this:</p>
<figure>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th scope="col">Country</th>
            <th scope="col">Population</th>
            <th scope="col">Language</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">UK</th>
            <td>63,182,000</td>
            <td>English</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">France</th>
            <td>64,898,000</td>
            <td>Français</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">Germany</th>
            <td>80,219,695</td>
            <td>Deutsch</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</figure>
<p>By default, browsers also render the text contained in any <code>th</code> elements in bold, which makes things more obvious for sighted users as well. A win-win situation.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#table-headers-and-bodies" id="table-headers-and-bodies">Table headers and bodies</a></h2>
<p>There is one final change we are going to make to our example table before we get back to work on our CV page, which again will add a little clarity for anything reading the code. The first row of our table is now composed entirely of <code>th</code> elements, but otherwise looks structurally similar to the other rows. To further differentiate it's component parts, we can split the table into a header and body.</p>
<p>To do this we wrap the first row with the column headings into a <code>thead</code> element and the rest of the rows into a <code>tbody</code> as below:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;Country&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;Population&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;Language&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;63,182,000&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;English&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;France&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;64,898,000&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;Français&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;Germany&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;80,219,695&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;Deutsch&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This won't change how the browser renders the table at all, it just helps us organise the data and provides further clues as to the meaning of the contents. There is also a <code>tfoot</code> to define a footer for a table, but this is less frequently seen. An example of it's use would be the totals row for a financial spreadsheet.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-cv-section" id="the-cv-section">The CV Section</a></h2>
<p>Now we have covered the syntax for building tables in HTML, we can finally add the next section to our page. Copy and paste the following lines between the end of the last <code>section</code> element, and the ending <code>main</code> tag.</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;/section&gt;
…
    &lt;section&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;My greatest achievements&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;table&gt;

                &lt;tr&gt;

                    &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;Employer&lt;/th&gt;
                    &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
                    &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/th&gt;
                &lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;/thead&gt;
            &lt;tbody&gt;

            &lt;/tbody&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
…
&lt;/main&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>All of these elements should now be familiar to you. We have added a new <code>section</code> with a <code>h2</code> and <code>table</code> as children. The <code>table</code> has a <code>thead</code> and <code>tbody</code> and all of the <code>th</code> elements have the appropriate <code>scope</code> attributes.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#wrapping-up-2" id="wrapping-up-2">Wrapping up</a></h2>
<p>Now that our page is starting to get a little longer, instead of showing the complete code for the page, I will just provide a link to the <a href="https://github.com/BezPowell/building_websites_for_beginners/blob/master/code/s1c7/index.html">final index.html for this chapter</a>.</p>
<p>I have talked a lot in this chapter about how we can use specific elements to give added meaning to our content. While many of the changes I made to the table will make no visual difference, and may seem unnecessary at first, you must remember that about 99.9% of the time your HTML files will be read by a computer, rather than a person.</p>
<p>While people are generally flexible and good at inferring meaning from context, machines (unfortunately) are invariably stubbornly inflexible and pendantic; and as our pages must first be processed by machines before anyone can view them, it is in our best interests to be as explicit with our code as we can. Also, if you come back to try and make changes to your pages months or years after initially making them, your future self will thank you if they are as clear and unambiguous as possible.</p>
<p>In the next chapter we will cover how to add links to pages and go over the difference between block and inline elements.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#links" id="links">Links</a></h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we added a table of past employments to our portfolio page. This detailed what positions the page's author had previously held, and the companies who employed them. It's likely that anyone reading this would at least be able to guess as to what the job entailed (especially if they are interested in the fields in which the author worked), but the employer may well be totally unfamiliar to them; to save anyone in this situation from having to search on the internet, we will provide a direct link to the various employer websites inside the table. This also provides me with a vaguely plausible reason for introducing you to hyperlinks in HTML, which (as mentioned in this section's introduction) are probably the single most important building block of the web, so should not be left out.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-a-tag" id="the-a-tag">The &lt;a&gt; tag</a></h2>
<p>In HTML, hyperlinks are defined using the <code>a</code> tag, which stands for anchor. The <code>a</code> element supports a <code>href</code> attribute, which specifies the URL that the link points to, and any text contained within the element will act as the link. An example is below:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/&quot;&gt;MDN web docs&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>which when rendered by the browser would appear like this: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">MDN web docs</a>.</p>
<p>Hyperlinks can also be made to open in a new tab or window by adding a <code>target=&quot;_blank&quot;</code> attribute to the element, but please use this judiciously, as it can be a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/use-target_blank/">change to user expected behaviour</a>. The text that you use to illustrate the link should also give some clue as to where the link leads, please avoid links that only say <a href="">click me</a> or, even worse, just <a href="">here</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#block-and-inline-elements" id="block-and-inline-elements">Block and Inline elements</a></h2>
<p>You may have noticed that the <code>a</code> elements in the previous paragraph have behaved a little differently from most of the other elements we've seen so far: they sit <em>within</em> the surrounding content, rather than starting a <em>new line</em>. This is because <code>a</code> is an <code>inline</code>, rather than a <code>block-level</code>, element.</p>
<p>By default, HTML documents are laid out according to <em>Normal Flow</em>, which closely matches a book or manuscript. Elements are divided into two categories, <code>block</code> and <code>inline</code>, with <code>inline</code> elements being laid out next to one another in the writing direction, like sentences of text; and <code>block</code> elements proceeding one after another perpendicular to the inline direction with line-breaks in-between, just like paragraphs.</p>
<p>To appreciate the difference between them, consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;
    Some paragraph text. This bit is &lt;strong&gt;more important&lt;/strong&gt; than the rest.
    It also contains a link to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bezpowell.github.io/building_websites_for_beginners/&quot;&gt;the introduction&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A list of items&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Contained within a ul&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;So order doesn't matter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Another paragraph for demonstration purposes.
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Here we have defined three ancestor elements (two <code>p</code>s and an <code>ul</code>), which are all <code>block-level</code>. The <code>ul</code> has three <code>li</code> elements as children, which are also <code>block level</code>; and the first <code>p</code> has a <code>strong</code><sup id="a1"><a href="s1c8.html#f1">1</a></sup> and <code>a</code> as children, which are both <code>inline</code>. When rendered by the browser, the example will be laid out like so:</p>
<figure>
    <p>
        Some paragraph text. This bit is <strong>more important</strong> than the rest.
        It also contains a link to <a href="https://bezpowell.github.io/building_websites_for_beginners/">the introduction</a>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A list of items</li>
        <li>Contained within a ul</li>
        <li>So order doesn't matter</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Another paragraph for demonstration purposes.
    </p>
</figure>
<p>All of the <code>block level</code> elements are laid out one after another perpendicular to the reading direction, with line breaks in-between. In most western languages this means that block level elements will be laid out starting at the top and working downwards, but depending on the language's reading direction they could go from top to bottom, left to right, or right to left.</p>
<p>In contrast to this, the <code>inline</code> elements are displayed next to one another as a continuos line in the writing direction. Again, here this is left to right, but will vary depending on the writing mode<sup id="a2"><a href="s1c8.html#f2">2</a></sup> of the document.</p>
<p>With the advent of HTML5 <code>block</code> and <code>inline</code> are not quite as strongly defined as they once were, and we will take a more in-depth look at the various ways we can alter Normal Flow in the next section on CSS.</p>
<p>For now, the main thing that we must be aware of is that HTML restricts what elements can be used as the descendants of other elements<sup id="a3"><a href="s1c8.html#f3">3</a></sup>. This varies from element to element, but the general rule is that while we can have inline elements as descendants of block level elements, it is invalid HTML to do the opposite. You may have as many <code>strong</code> elements inside a <code>p</code> as you wanted, but you can not include a <code>h2</code> inside a <code>strong</code>. The main exception to this rule is the <code>a</code> element, which can accept block-level elements as descendants.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#adding-the-employer-hyperlinks" id="adding-the-employer-hyperlinks">Adding the employer hyperlinks</a></h2>
<p>Now that we know how to add hyperlinks to documents, and understand that that can only be the parents of certain elements, we can add the employer website hyperlinks to our table. As this is such a minor change, I will not show you what to do and will ask you to have a go at doing it yourselves. Remember that you can look at <a href="https://github.com/BezPowell/building_websites_for_beginners/blob/master/code/s1c8/index.html">this chapter's source code</a> if you get stuck.</p>
<p>In the next chapter we will look at forms, which allow visitors to interact with your website.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#footnotes-4" id="footnotes-4">Footnotes</a></h3>
<ol>
    <li id="f1">The strong element stands for Strong Importance, and is used to mark content out as having particular importance or urgency.</li>
    <li id="f2">The document's writing mode is generally determined by the language set in the html lang attribute, but can be overridden on an element by element basis.</li>
    <li id="f3">ol and ul elements may only have li as children, for example.</li>
</ol><h1><a class="header" href="#forms" id="forms">Forms</a></h1>
<p>Now that our simple portfolio page contains a table of our previous employments, the only thing left to do is add a way for people to contact us; after all, there is no point wowing prospective employers with our skills and experience if they can not get in touch with us.</p>
<p>So far, everything that we have added to our page has been to provide the visitor with information, as doing so is often the primary purpose of a HTML document<sup id="a1"><a href="s1c9.html#f1">1</a></sup>. Sometimes, however, you need the information to flow in the other direction, to collect information from the user; and forms in HTML are how you do that. Just like their paper equivalents, they consist of a series of fields that visitors fill in, which when submitted can be read and processed. </p>
<p>Here, we're using a form to allow visitors to send us a message, but they can be used for almost anything where you need to collect data from the visitor; think website logins, getting driving directions, online checkouts, web search engines etc.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#collecting-data" id="collecting-data">Collecting data</a></h2>
<p>To create a form in HTML we use the <code>form</code> element, which then accepts a number of different types of elements as children which act as the fields of the form. When a visitor fills in these fields and submits the form, any data they have entered will be sent to whatever url is specified in the form's <code>action</code> attribute. HTML itself can not do anything with the information that users submit, it can only send it to somewhere else for processing.</p>
<p>This can be very confusing for beginners, as doing anything with the data that users have submitted using your forms requires learning a whole new programming language. However, by decoupling the collection of data from the processing of it, it grants us tremendous flexibility; we can decide whether we want to use that data to log a user in to our website, send them a set of tickets for a particular concert, add their observations to an amateur scientific project, or simple email us a copy of what they entered.</p>
<p>Learning one of these so called 'backend' languages is out of the scope of this book, but fortunately there are services that can handle ths for us, and we will be using one of these for our simple contact form. Before we start looking at processing the data from a form, however, we first need to look at collecting it.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#inputs" id="inputs">Inputs</a></h2>
<p>As alluded to earlier, a <code>form</code> element can accept several types of elements as children to act as its fields. The most common of these is the <code>input</code> element, which has a <code>type</code> attribute to define what type of data we are expecting, and a <code>name</code> attribute to identify the field when we come to process the data.</p>
<p>Users fill out the form by focusing each input in turn to fill them out, and then submitting the form when they have completed it. Focusing an element is often performed by clicking or touching into it with a mouse our touchscreen, but can also be achieved using the <code>tab</code> key on a keyboard to move between them.</p>
<p>An extremely simple form could be created like so:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;form action=&quot;https://example.com&quot;&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Submit Form&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Here we have defined a simple form with two <code>input</code>s. The first is a text field called name, and the second acts as a button to allow submitting the form. When rendered in a browser it will look something like this:</p>
<figure>
    <form action="https://example.com">
        <input type="text" name="name" />
        <input type="submit" value="Submit Form" />        
    </form>
</figure>
<p>When a user clicks (or touches, or presses enter on their keyboard, or any other way of interacting with it) on the button any data they have entered into the name input will be sent to <code>https://example.com</code>. What is done with the data when it gets there will be entirely dependant on what use the form is trying to serve.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#labels" id="labels">Labels</a></h2>
<p>Our single field form is already completely functional, but it does not convey to the user what information we are expecting them to give us. For that purpose, HTML has the <code>label</code> element. These accept a <code>for</code> attribute, which contains the <code>id</code> of the element they are associated with, and any content they are given will become the label. In HTML, the <code>id</code> attribute can be applied to any element, and should be a unique identifier for that specific element; normally we don't have a use for these, but in particular circumstances (such as adding a label here) we may need to add one.</p>
<p>We could add a label to our text <code>input</code> like so:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;form action=&quot;https://example.com&quot;&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Your name&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; id=&quot;name&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Submit Form&quot; /&gt;        
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>and when rendered by the browser it would look like this:</p>
<figure>
    <form action="https://example.com">
        <label for="name">Your name</label>
        <input type="text" name="name" id="name" />
        <input type="submit" value="Submit Form" />        
    </form>
</figure>
<p>Labels are extremely useful, as the text of a <code>label</code> associated with an <code>input</code> is read out to screen-reader users when they focus on the input. Also, if users click or touch the label it will automatically move focus to the input, ready to enter data.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#other-field-types" id="other-field-types">Other field types</a></h2>
<p>So far, we have only seen a plain text field, but HTML supports many other types of inputs. The <code>input</code> element itself supports many different values for its <code>type</code> attribute, including: <code>number</code>, <code>email</code>, <code>password</code>, <code>color</code>, <code>date</code> and <code>file</code> etc. By specifying the correct type of input the browser will change how they are presented to the user (such as a date picker for the date field, or increment and decrement arrows on numbers) and will perform some basic validation on the inputs to ensure the user has entered the right kind of data (checking that a valid email address was entered, or only a number into a number field for example).</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#selects" id="selects">Selects</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the <code>input</code> element, there are also a few other types of element that can be used as fields. An example of this is the <code>select</code> element, which has one or more <code>option</code> elements as children; the contents of which provide the items in a drop-down list. We could create a select field for booking tickets to events like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;form action=&quot;/booking&quot;&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;ticket-type&quot;&gt;Type of ticket:&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;select name=&quot;ticket-type&quot; id =&quot;ticket-type&quot;&gt;
        &lt;option value=&quot;standing&quot;&gt;Standing&lt;/option&gt;
        &lt;option value=&quot;box&quot;&gt;Box&lt;/option&gt;
        &lt;option value=&quot;backstage&quot;&gt;Backstage Pass&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;/select&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Ordinarily, the value of a field when the form is submitted will be whatever data the user entered, but in the case of a <code>select</code> element it will be the <code>value</code> attribute of the selected <code>option</code>. When rendered by the browser the above form would appear like this:</p>
<figure>
    <form action="/booking">
        <label for="ticket-type">Type of ticket:</label>
        <select name="ticket-type" id ="ticket-type">
            <option value="standing">Standing</option>
            <option value="box">Box</option>
            <option value="backstage">Backstage Pass</option>
        </select>
    </form>
</figure>
<h3><a class="header" href="#textareas" id="textareas">Textareas</a></h3>
<p>The text input used in our first example form only works for a single line of text, such as a name or message subject. For multi-line fields we instead use a <code>textarea</code>. Just like an <code>input</code> the <code>textarea</code> should have an associated <code>label</code> and can have the number of allowed characters restricted using a <code>minlength</code> and <code>maxlength</code> attribute. Unlike <code>input</code>s, however, a <code>textarea</code> is not self-closing and must have a closing tag like so:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;textarea&gt;
&lt;/textarea&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>There are many other possible children allowed for a <code>form</code> element that I have not covered here. A good reference for all of them, and the attributes they can accept, is on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Basic_native_form_controls">MDN</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#building-a-contact-form" id="building-a-contact-form">Building a contact form</a></h2>
<p>Now that we know how to create a form in HTMl, we are ready to add one to our page. For processing any data submitted to the form I used an online service called <a href="https://getform.io/">getform.io</a><sup id="a2"><a href="s1c9.html#f2">2</a></sup>. It is a paid service, but at the time of writing they have a free plan where you can add a single form and accept up to 50 submissions a month.</p>
<p>Generally, any external service must be thoroughly checked for security and how they handle your data, but for the purposes of testing it should be fine. If you happen to be experienced in any of the backend languages that can be used to process form data feel free to write that part yourself.</p>
<p>First of all, let's add the contact form to our portfolio page. Insert the following lines after the last <code>section</code> and before the closing <code>main</code> tag:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;section&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Get in touch&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;form action=&quot;https://getform.io/f/921c2467-5918-4ddd-88e5-ee8f7674034d&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;label for=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Your Name:&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; id=&quot;name&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;label for=&quot;email&quot;&gt;Your Email:&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;input type=&quot;email&quot; name=&quot;email&quot; id=&quot;email&quot; required=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;label for=&quot;subject&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;subject&quot; id=&quot;subject&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;label for=&quot;message&quot;&gt;Message:&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;textarea name=&quot;message&quot; id=&quot;message&quot; required=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;Send&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>As before we have added a new <code>section</code> element to hold our contact form. The <code>form</code> itself has an action url pointing to whatever page will process our data. In the case of the example this is my test form on getform.io, but you will need to replace it with the url that is unique to your form. The <code>method=&quot;POST&quot;</code> attribute is indicating that this form's data should be sent with a <code>POST</code>, rather than a <code>GET</code>, request. The differences between the two are a little complex to worry about for now<sup id="a3"><a href="s1c9.html#f3">3</a></sup> but, essentially, a <code>POST</code> request is more secure; what you want when sending any form of personal information. </p>
<p>By default, <code>inputs</code> and <code>labels</code> are both inline elements, and I have wrapped them in simple <code>div</code> tags to separate them out. A <code>div</code> is a semantically meaningless block level element that can be used to group elements when no other specific elements are appropriate.</p>
<p>The only other thing which is new in this example is the addition of the <code>required</code> attribute to the email and message fields. Any fields that are marked as <code>required</code> will prevent the user from submitting the form if they are empty and the browser will display a message indicating that they should be filled in. Please use these judiciously as they can be confusing to users, but insisting that a contact form must have a message and way of getting back in touch with the user seems reasonable.</p>
<p>The only other thing to do now is to setup the form processing. If you decide to use the same service as myself they have some good <a href="https://app.getform.io/docs">documentation on how to do this</a>. Essentially, all you want to do is create a new form, copy the action url into the <code>action</code> attribute of the <code>form</code> on your portfolio page, and setup an email notification. Their documentation covers all of this.</p>
<p>If you decide you would like to process the data in another way feel free to do so.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#wrapping-up-3" id="wrapping-up-3">Wrapping up</a></h2>
<p>Now that the contact form has been added, the HTML for our basic portfolio page is complete. If you run into any issues, or just want to see what my version looks like, you can get the <a href="https://github.com/BezPowell/building_websites_for_beginners/blob/master/code/s1c9/index.html">page's source code on github</a>.</p>
<p>We've covered a huge amount over the last nine chapters, and if there is something you are still unsure of please do go back and read it again. The best way to learn is by doing, so do try putting your new skills to the test by making some other webpages.

<p>The main thing to writing good HTML is using appropriate elements for the content. As there are more elements available than can be comfortably remembered a good reference is essential, and perhaps the best is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">Mozilla Developer Network</a>; they also have some excellent tutorials that explain many of the concepts we have covered in greater depth.</p>
<p>In the next section we will look at CSS. Another language of the web that allows us to change the visual display of web pages.</p>

</ol><h1><a class="header" href="#css" id="css">CSS</a></h1>
<p>Whereas HTML is the language responsible for defining the content of a webpage, CSS is the language used to control its visual presentation. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, a style-sheet being an external file<sup id="a1"><a href="s2c1.html#f1">1</a></sup> (sheet) that controls the look or visual layout (style) of a document. The cascade is the mechanism with which CSS determines which styles should be applied to an element, and we will explore how this works soon.</p>
<p>As we briefly alluded to in the section on HTML, the huge benefit of CSS is it allows us to separate the visual presentation of a document from the contents. By defining the look of a website in a separate .css file (which is then referenced from each .html document on the site) we can share it across every page on a website; instead of having to set our styles on each page, we can define it once and know that all elements will look the same on each page of the site. If we then want to update how something is displayed at a later date, we only have to do it in one location, instead of going through every page of the site and making the same change in each.</p>
<p>CSS also allows us to alter the visual presentation of the document depending on the characteristics of the device it is being rendered on; changing the layout between mobile and desktop, for instance, or removing all the colour when printed out<sup id="a2"><a href="s2c1.html#f2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This flexability has allowed the development of 'responsive design': instead of having a different page for mobile devices and desktops, we can instead build websites that adapt to fit the devices they are being viewed on - so no matter what device our visitors are using, our pages will work for them.</p>
<p>Just like HTML, CSS files are simple text files that follow a specific type of formatting. Unlike HTML, however, CSS is not a markup language and  has its own unique rules. We will start to look at the syntax of CSS in the next chapter and throughout this section will apply what we are learning to our portfolio page from the previous section.</p>

    <li id="f1">Technically, it is possible to add CSS styles directly to a HTML document, but that loses the tremendous flexability that keeping the visual presentation separate from the content allows us.</li>
    <li id="f2">Yes, a printer is a separate device on the web and can be given unique styles.</li>
</ol><h1><a class="header" href="#selectors-and-rulesets" id="selectors-and-rulesets">Selectors and Rulesets</a></h1>
<p>CSS stylesheets are composed of a series of rulesets, which describe how the browser should style a particular element. They are made up of a <code>selector</code> (which is what the browser uses to determine which elements the ruleset should be applied to) and one or more sets of properties and values. A <code>property</code> is an aspect of the element that can be changed (such as the colour or font) and the <code>value</code> is what that property should be set to (e.g. red or Times New Roman). Consider a simple example:</p>
<pre><code>p {
    color: red;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This simple ruleset will set all <code>p</code> elements on the page to have the colour<sup id="a1"><a href="s2c2.html#f1">1</a></sup> red. Here, <code>p</code> is the selector and refers to all <code>p</code> elements on the page; the opening and closing curly braces <code>{}</code> enclose the ruleset; <code>color</code> is the property; and <code>red</code> is the value, following the property after a colon <code>:</code> and ending in a semi-colon <code>;</code>.</p>
<p>When applied to some sample elements this ruleset would have the following effect:</p>
<figure>
    <h3><a class="header" href="#a-level-3-heading" id="a-level-3-heading">A level 3 heading</a></h3>
    <p style="color: red;">A paragraph of text</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An unordered list</li>
        <li>With 2 list items</li>
    </ul>
</figure>
<p>Any property/value pairs defined inside of the ruleset will be applied to all elements that match the selector, so if we wanted to also set the font of paragraphs to Times New Roman we could add that property to the ruleset like so:</p>
<pre><code>p {
    color: red;
    font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>font-family</code> property accepts a comma separated list of fonts. If the visitor does not have the leftmost font installed on their device, the browser will work its way right until it finds one that is available to use. In the case of the final <code>serif</code> declaration this is a generic family name and a final fallback. All fonts with spaces in their names must also be enclosed in quotation marks.</p>
<p>Our example will now display like this:</p>
<figure>
    <h3><a class="header" href="#a-level-3-heading-1" id="a-level-3-heading-1">A level 3 heading</a></h3>
    <p style="color: red;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">A paragraph of text</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An unordered list</li>
        <li>With 2 list items</li>
    </ul>
</figure>
<p>What if we wanted to apply our ruleset to more than one type of element? It is quite likely that if we set the colour and font of our paragraphs we might want to also use the same setting on list items. We could create another identical ruleset with a different selector, but CSS also allows use to specify multiple selectors for a single ruleset by separating them with commas, like so:</p>
<pre><code>p, li {
    color: red;
    font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Which when applied to our example will cause the browser to render it like this:</p>
<figure>
    <h3><a class="header" href="#a-level-3-heading-2" id="a-level-3-heading-2">A level 3 heading</a></h3>
    <p style="color: red;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">A paragraph of text</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="color: red;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">An unordered list</li>
        <li style="color: red;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">With 2 list items</li>
    </ul>
</figure>
<h2><a class="header" href="#inheritance" id="inheritance">Inheritance</a></h2>
<p>Any properties that you don't explicitly set values for in a ruleset will instead use the browser defaults<sup id="a2"><a href="s2c2.html#f2">2</a></sup>. We can exploit this behaviour to make our styles apply to more elements without adding each one to the selector, as many properties (including the <code>color</code> and <code>font-family</code> properties we have already used) default to a value of <code>inherit</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>inherit</code> value means that the element will take the <code>computed value</code> for that property from its parent. Certain properties in CSS can take a value that includes a calculation. The value that we set in our stylesheets is referred to as the <code>specified value</code> and the value that is actually applied to the element is known as the <code>computed value</code>.</p>
<p>An example of this is when using one of the relative <code>length</code> units. Properties in CSS that accept a <code>length</code> unit, such as the <code>font-size</code> (somewhat confusingly this accepts a length), can either be specified in absolute units, such as pixels <code>px</code>, or relative units such as <code>em</code>s. 1 <code>em</code> is equal to the computed font-size of the parent element.</p>
<p>Lets look at a simple example:</p>
<pre><code>ul {
    font-size: 20px;
}

li {
    font-size: 0.5em;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the <code>ul</code> element has its <code>font-size</code> property set to <code>20px</code>; the <code>specified value</code> is <code>20px</code> and the <code>computed value</code> is also <code>20px</code>. In contrast to this, the <code>li</code> uses a relative length of <code>0.5em</code>; its <code>specified value</code> is <code>0.5em</code>, but its <code>computed value</code> is <code>10px</code> (20 x 0.5 = 10).</p>
<p>In the case of a property that has its value set to <code>inherit</code>, the <code>computed value</code> for it will be the same as the <code>computed value</code> of the first ancestor that has a <code>specified value</code> other than <code>inherit</code>. The browser will work its way up the tree of ancestors until it finds one that has a value explicitly set, compute this, and then apply it to all of its descendants that inherit from it.</p>
<p>What this means in practice, is that we can set the value of a property on an element, and all of its descendants will inherit that value (if the properties' default value is <code>inherit</code> of course.)</p>
<p>Both the <code>color</code> and <code>font-family</code> properties that we used in the previous example default to a value of <code>inherit</code>. This means that we could set those on the <code>body</code> element<sup id="a3"><a href="s2c2.html#f3">3</a></sup>, and every other element in our example would inherit them like so:</p>
<pre><code>body {
    color: red;
    font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Our example will now look like this:</p>
<figure style="color: red;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
    <h3 style="color: inherit;font-family: inherit;">A level 3 heading</h3>
    <p style="color: inherit;font-family: inherit;">A paragraph of text</p>
    <ul style="color: inherit;font-family: inherit;">
        <li style="color: inherit;font-family: inherit;">An unordered list</li>
        <li style="color: inherit;font-family: inherit;">With 2 list items</li>
    </ul>
</figure>
<p>Every line of CSS that you write increases the size of your webpage, which means it takes longer to download for visitors. If you have specified the same styles for multiple elements, and then decide you want to change how they are displayed, you would also have to update those styles in multiple places. The fewer rulesets you can use to achieve the look you want, the better it is for both yourself and your users.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#conclusion" id="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>That's quite a bit we've gone over in this chapter. CSS can be quite deceptive in terms of how easy it is to write, but it still remains very powerful.</p>
<p>In the next chapter we will learn how to actually load a stylesheet into a HTML document and explore what happens when you don't want all elements of the same type to have the same styles.</p>
