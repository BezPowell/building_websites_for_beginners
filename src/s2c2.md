# Selectors and Rulesets
CSS stylesheets are composed of a series of rulesets, which describe how the browser should style a particular element. They are made up of a selector (which is what the browser uses to determing which elements the ruleset should be applied to) and one or more sets of properties and values. A property is an aspect of the element that can be changed (such as the colour or font) and the value is what that property should be set to (e.g. red or Times New Roman). Consider a simple example:
```
p {
    color: red;
}
```
This simple ruleset will set all `p` elements on the page to have the colour<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> red. Here, `p` is the selector and refers to all `p` elements on the page; the opening and closing curly braces `{}` enclose the ruleset; `color` is the property; and `red` is the value, following the property after a colon `:` and ending in a semi-colon `;`.

When applied to some sample elements this ruleset would have the following effect:

<figure>
    <h3>A level 3 heading</h3>
    <p style="color: red;">A paragraph of text</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An unordered list</li>
        <li>With 2 list items</li>
    </ul>
</figure>

Any property/value pairs defined inside of the ruleset will be applied to all elements that match the selector, so if we wanted to also set the font of paragraphs to Times New Roman we could change the ruleset like so:
```
p {
    color: red;
    font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
}
```
The `font-family` property accepts a comma separated list of fonts. If the visitor does not have the leftmost font installed on their computer, the browser will work its way right until it finds one that is available to use. In the case of the final `serif` deceleration this is a generic family name and a final fallback. All fonts with spaces in their names must also be enclosed in quotation marks.

Our example will now display like this:
<figure>
    <h3>A level 3 heading</h3>
    <p style="color: red;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">A paragraph of text</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An unordered list</li>
        <li>With 2 list items</li>
    </ul>
</figure>

What if we wanted to apply our ruleset to more than one type of element? It is quite likely that if we set the colour and font of our paragraphs we might want to also use the same setting on list items. We could create another identical ruleset with a different selector, but CSS also allows use to specify multiple selectors for a single ruleset by separating them with commas, like so:
```
p, li {
    color: red;
    font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
}
```
Which when applied to our example will cause the browser to render it like this:
<figure>
    <h3>A level 3 heading</h3>
    <p style="color: red;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">A paragraph of text</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="color: red;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">An unordered list</li>
        <li style="color: red;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">With 2 list items</li>
    </ul>
</figure>

### Footnotes
<ol>
    <li id="f1">CSS uses the American spelling of the word. For those of you, like myself, who use the British spelling this can be very confusing at first. Unfortunately, we are stuck with it this way, but you soon should be able to switch between the two in your head with little difficulty.</li>
