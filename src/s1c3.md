# Hello world
Now that you know what html tags and elements are we can look at our first webpage. There is an old tradition whe learning any new computer language to first write something to display the sentence "Hello world!" to confirm everything is working correctly, and we are going to follow this.

To start with please create a new file somewhere where you will keep your new webpages and call it `hello_world.html`, then open the file in a text editor and paste the following lines into it:
```
<!doctype html>

<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Hello world</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
</body>

</html>
```
If you then save the file and open it in a web browser you should see something like this:
