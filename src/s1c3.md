# Hello world
Now that you know what html tags and elements are we can look at our first webpage. There is an old tradition when learning any new computer language to first write something to display the sentence "Hello world!" to confirm everything is working correctly, and we are going to follow this.

To start with, please create a new file somewhere where you will keep your new webpages and call it `hello_world.html`, then open the file in a text editor and paste the following lines into it:
```
<!doctype html>

<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Hello world</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
</body>

</html>
```
If you then save the file and open it in a web browser you should see something like this:

![hello_world.html rendered in Firefox](./images/s1c3/01.png)

There is a little bit more html here than I have shown you previously, but we will go over it line by line to explain what each element does.

The first element in the document is `<!doctype html>`, this is simply a marker to tell the web browser that the document is a html document. It also indicates that this document is formatted according to the HTML 5 specification, which is the current standard.
