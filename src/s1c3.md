# Hello world
Now that you know what html tags and elements are we can look at our first webpage. There is an old tradition when learning any new computer language to first write something to display the sentence "Hello world!" to confirm everything is working correctly, and we are going to follow this.

To start with, please create a new file somewhere where you will keep your new webpages and call it `hello_world.html`, then open the file in a text editor and paste the following lines into it:
```
<!doctype html>

<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Hello world</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
</body>

</html>
```
If you then save the file and open it in a web browser you should see something like this:

![hello_world.html rendered in Firefox](./images/s1c3/01.png)

There is a little bit more html here than I have shown you previously, but we will go over it line by line to explain what each element does.

The first element in the document is `<!doctype html>`, this is simply a marker to tell the web browser that the document is a html document. It also indicates that this document is formatted according to the HTML5 specification<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>, which is the current standard.

## Attributes

The next element is a bit more interesting as it introduces something we've not encountered before, have a look at just the html element, I've put an elipsis `…` to indicate that there is other content in between the opening and closing tags that we are not currently interested in.
```
<html lang="en">
    …
</html>
```
You will notice that there is some other text in the opening tag, after the tag type, but before the closing angle bracket. This is what is called an attribute. Attributes give additional meaning to elements than their type alone confers. In the case of the html element, it has a language attribute indicating that the content of the webpage is written in the English language. Other possibilities include `fr` for French and `ar` for Arabic.

Attributes consist of the name of the attribute (what type it is), an `=` sign and the value of the attribute (almost always enclosed in quotation marks `""`). Elements can have any number of attributes and they are separated from one another (and the tag name) by a space.
