# Forms
Now that our simple portfolio page contains a table of our previous employments, the only thing left to do is add a way for people to contact us; after all, there is no point wowing prospective employers with our skills and experience if they can not get in touch with us.

So far, everything that we have added to our page has been to provide the visitor with information, as doing so is often the primary purpose of a HTML document. Sometimes, however, you need the information to flow in the other direction, to collect information from the user; and forms in HTML are how you do that. Just like their paper equivalents, they consist of a series of fields that visitors fill in, which when submitted can be read and processed. 

Here, we're using a form to allow visitors to send us a message, but they can be used for almost anything where you need to collect data from the visitor; think website logins, getting driving directions, online checkouts, web search engines etc.

## Collecting data
To create a form in HTML we use the `form` element, which then accepts a number of different types of elements as children which act as the fields of the form. When a visitor fills in these fields and submits the form, any data they have entered will be sent to whatever url is specified in the form's `action` attribute. HTML itself can not do anything with the information that users submit, it can only send it to somewhere else for processing.

This can be very confusing for beginners, as doing anything with the data that users have submitted using your forms requires learning a whole new programming language. However, by decoupling the collection of data from the processing of it, it grants us tremendous flexibility; we can decide whether we want to use that data to log a user in to our website, send them a set of tickets for a particular concert, add their observations to an amateur scientific project, or simple email us a copy of what they entered.

Learning one of these so called 'backend' languages is out of the scope of this book, but fortunately there are services that can handle ths for us, and we will be using one of these for our simple contact form. Before we start looking at processing the data from a form, however, we first need to look at collecting it.

## Inputs
As alluded to earlier, a `form` element can accept several types of elements as children to act as its fields. The most common of these is the `input` element, which has a `type` attribute to define what type of data we are expecting, and a `name` attribute to identify the field when we come to process the data.

Users fill out the form by focusing each input in turn to fill them out, and then submitting the form when they have completed it. Focusing an element is often performed by clicking or touching into it with a mouse our touchscreen, but can also be achieved using the `tab` key on a keyboard to move between them.

An extremely simple form could be created like so:

```
<form action="https::/example.com">
    <input type="text" name="name" />
    <input type="submit" value="Submit Form" />
</form>
```
Here we have defined a simple form with two `input`s. The first is a text field called name, and the second acts as an input button to allow submitting the form. When rendered in a browser it will look something like this:

<figure>
    <form action="https::/example.com">
        <input type="text" name="name" />
        <input type="submit" value="Submit Form" />        
    </form>
</figure>

When a user clicks (or touches, or presses enter on their keyboard, or any other way of interacting with it) on the button any data they have entered into the name input will be sent to `https::/example.com`. What is done with the data when it gets there will be entirely dependant on what use the form is trying to serve.

## Labels
Our single field form is already completely functional, but it does not convey to the user what information we are expecting them to give us. For that purpose, HTML has the `label` element. These accept a `for` attribute, which contains the `id` of the element they are associated with, and any content they are given will become the label. In HTML, the `id` attribute can be applied to any element, and should be a unique identifier for that specific element; normally we don't have a use for these, but in particular circumstances (such as adding a label here) it can be useful to add one.

We could add a label to our text `input` like so:
```
<form action="https::/example.com">
    <label for="name">Your name</label>
    <input type="text" name="name" id="name" />
    <input type="submit" value="Submit Form" />        
</form>
```
and when rendered by the browser it would look like this:
<figure>
    <form action="https::/example.com">
        <label for="name">Your name</label>
        <input type="text" name="name" id="name" />
        <input type="submit" value="Submit Form" />        
    </form>
</figure>

Labels are extremely useful, as the text of a `label` associated with an `input` is read out to screen-reader users when they focus on the input. Also, if users click or touch the label it also automatically focuses the input, ready to enter data.

## Other field types
So far, we have only seen a plain text field, but HTML supports many other types of inputs. The `input` element itself supports many different values for its `type` attribute, including: `number`, `email`, `password`, `color`, `date` and `file` etc. By specifying the correct type of input the browser will change how they are presented to the user (such as a date picker for the date field, or increment and decrement arrows on numbers) and will perform some basic validation on the inputs to ensure the user has entered the right kind of data (checking that a valid email address was entered, or only a number into a number field for example).

### Selects
In addition to the `input` element, there are also a few other types of element that can be used as fields. An example of this is the `select` element, which has one or more `option` elements as children; the values of which provide the items in a drop-down list. We could create a select field for booking tickets to events like this:
```
<form action="/booking">
    <label for="ticket-type">Type of ticket:</label>
    <select name="ticket-type" id ="ticket-type">
        <option value="standing">Standing</option>
        <option value="box">Box</option>
        <option value="backstage">Backstage Pass</option>
    </select>
</form>
```
When rendered by the browser it would appear like this:
<figure>
    <form action="/booking">
        <label for="ticket-type">Type of ticket:</label>
        <select name="ticket-type" id ="ticket-type">
            <option value="standing">Standing</option>
            <option value="box">Box</option>
            <option value="backstage">Backstage Pass</option>
        </select>
    </form>
</figure>
