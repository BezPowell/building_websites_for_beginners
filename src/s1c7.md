# Tables
The next thing we are going to work on for our page is the details of our author's past employments. Before we start writing any HTML, however, we should take a brief moment to think about how it would be best to represent it. If you look at a typical CV, as well as the employer, they generally contain information about the job title, dates of employment, and a paragraph or two detailing what the job actually entailed. We could convey this by having the job titles or employers as some form of heading element, and any other information as paragraphs; but this would not express the fact that each of these fields are related to one another.

The perfect element to represent such 2-dimensional data is a table and, in fact, is often what is used on paper CVs as well. Tables in HTML, unfortunately, do how a small number of minor drawbacks, the main one being the difficulty of representing a two dimensional grid in a markup language. As a result of this, the markup for tables is probably the most complex of any element you will encounter when building websites. So instead of overwhelming you with the final markup for the section as I have done previously, we will first learn about how to create tables in a series of smaller stages. This won't take long, I promise.

## \<tr>s and \<td>s
The first element we need to create a table is aptly named the `table`. This serves as the container for all of the data and indicates that anything inside of it is part of the table. The table contents are then split up into rows, represented by `tr` elements (which stands for table row). Each row then has it's cell data populated using `td` elements (which stands for table header). Confused? Let's look at an example:
```
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Country</td>
        <td>Population</td>
        <td>Language</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>UK</td>
        <td>63,182,000</td>
        <td>English</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>France</td>
        <td>64,898,000</td>
        <td>Français</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Germany</td>
        <td>80,219,695</td>
        <td>Deutsch</td>
    </tr>
</table>
```
This represents a table with 4 rows and 3 columns. As you can see, each `tr` is a child of the `table`, and the `td` elements are children of the `tr` rows. When displayed on a page it will look like this:
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Country</td>
        <td>Population</td>
        <td>Language</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>UK</td>
        <td>63,182,000</td>
        <td>English</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>France</td>
        <td>64,898,000</td>
        <td>Français</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Germany</td>
        <td>80,219,695</td>
        <td>Deutsch</td>
    </tr>
</table>

We do not explicitly declare columns in HTML, instead they are inferred from the number of cells in each row. This format can feel extremely unwieldy when you first encounter it but, as mentioned earlier, stems from the difficulty of trying to lay out a grid using markup. If the specs actually tried to lay out cells in the same way they appear you could get very long lines on tables which have paragraphs in some of the cells. After you have worked on a few pages with tables on them you should get the hang of it and it will become second nature.
