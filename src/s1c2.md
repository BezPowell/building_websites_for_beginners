# Tags and Elements
The world wide web contains a multitude of languages; you've probably visited web sites with pages written in English, French, German, Chinese, Arabic and many others. These are all, of course, languages for communication between humans. A different class of languages are those which are used for communication between humans and computers. The language that humans use for describing the contents of a web page to web browsers is called HTML.

HTML stands for Hyper-Text Markup Language. Hyper-Text is essentially techno-geek speak for documents that link to other documents. You will have seen this all over the web, whether it is links to other pages on a single website, links between websites, or other forms of links such as those that start a new email to a particular recipient, and they are one of the fundamental features that makes the web so useful.

Language of course means that HTML is one of the those languages that allow humans to talk to computers that we referred to a moment ago. That leaves markup, which refers to HTML being a language for annotating text, that may sound a little obscure, but for all practical purposes boils down to tags.

## Tags
Tags are a way of assigning meaning to text. To start to understand what this entails let's look at an example of two simple tags:
```
<h1>I like cats</h1>
<p>I like cats</p>
```
