# Links
In the previous chapter we added a table of past employments to our portfolio page. This detailed what positions the page's author had previously held, and the companies who employed them. It's likely that anyone reading this would at least be able to guess as to what the job entailed (especially if they are interested in the fields in which the author worked), but the employer may well be totally unfamiliar to them; to save anyone in this situation from having to search on the internet, we will provide a direct link to the various employer websites inside the table. This also provides me with a vaguely plausible reason for introducing you to hyperlinks in HTML, which (as mentioned in this section's introduction) are probably the single most important building block of the web, so should not be left out.

## The \<a> tag
In HTML, hyperlinks are defined using the `a` tag, which stands for anchor. The `a` element supports a `href` attribute, which specifies the URL that the link points to, and any text contained within the element will act as the link. An example is below:
```
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">MDN web docs</a>
```
which when rendered by the browser would appear like this: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">MDN web docs</a>.

Hyperlinks can also be made to open in a new tab or window by adding a `target="_blank"` attribute to the element, but please use this judiciously, as it can be a [change to user expected behaviour](https://css-tricks.com/use-target_blank/). The text that you use to illustrate the link should also give some clue as to where the link leads, please avoid links that only say *click me* or, even worse, just *here*.

## Block and Inline elements
You may have noticed that the `a` elements in the previous paragraph have behaved a little differently from most of the other elements we've seen so far: they sit *within* the surrounding content, rather than starting a *new line*. This is because `a` is an `inline`, rather than a `block-level`, element. To appreciate the difference between them, consider the following example:
```
<p>
    Some paragraph text. This bit is <strong>more important</strong> than the rest.
    It also contains a link to <a href="https://bezpowell.github.io/building_websites_for_beginners/">the introduction</a>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>A list of items</li>
    <li>Contained within a ul</li>
    <li>So order doesn't matter</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Another paragraph for demonstration purposes.
</p>
```
Here we have defined two `p`s and an `ul` with three `li`s, these are all `block level` elements and are laid out one after another perpendicular to the reading direction, with line breaks in-between. In most western languages this means that block level elements will be laid out starting at the top and working downwards, but depending on the language's reading direction they could go from top to bottom, left to right, or right to left.

In contrast to this, the `a` and `strong` elements are both `inline`, meaning they will be displayed next to one another as a continuos line in the reading direction. When rendered by the browser, the example will be laid out like so:

<figure>
    <p>
        Some paragraph text. This bit is <strong>more important</strong> than the rest.
        It also contains a link to <a href="https://bezpowell.github.io/building_websites_for_beginners/">the introduction</a>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A list of items</li>
        <li>Contained within a ul</li>
        <li>So order doesn't matter</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Another paragraph for demonstration purposes.
    </p>
</figure>

We will take a more in-depth look at the implications of block vs inline elements in the next section on CSS, when we see how they effect styling our webpage. For now, the main thing that we must be aware of is that, while we can have inline elements as descendants of block level elements, it is invalid HTML to do the opposite. You may have as many `strong` elements inside a `p` as you wanted, but you can not include a `h2` inside a `strong`. The single exception to this rule is the `a` element, which can accept block-level elements as descendants.
