# Basic page structure

In this chapter we're going to begin work on the initial html structure of our first website. To start with, copy the `hello_world.html` file we made in Chapter 3 into a new folder for our current project (mine is called website_1_final, but you probably want to name it something a bit more friendly) and rename it `index.html`. The reason we are renaming the file is that when you come to actually upload your website to the web, the server that hosts it will need to locate which file it should serve to visitors when they request a page. The convention is often to have each page in it's own folder, with the structure of the folders mirroring that of the pages on the website. When the server comes to look in the appropriate folder for a particular page, it will generally first look for a file called `index.html`, so we're just making its job as easy as possible.

Once you have renamed the file open it in a text editor, and edit the contenets to match this:
```
<!doctype html>

<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">

    <title>My website</title>
</head>

<body>
    <header>
    </header>
    <main>
    </main>
    <footer>
    </footer>
</body>

</html>
```

What we have done here is replace the `h1` in the body with three empty elements and changed the content of the title element (use whatever text you want here).
