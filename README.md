# building_websites_for_beginners

Building Websites for Beginners aims to provide a gentle introduction to building websites for complete beginners. It is currently in a very early stage with only the first few chapters written, but the plan is to keep adding to it as and when I have time and to write everything in the open on github. When complete, it should cover the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript alongside the basics of accessibility and front-end performance.
